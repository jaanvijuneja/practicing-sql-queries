1) Create database
2) Create empty table

CREATE TABLE sales_data (
    id INT,
    date DATE,
    category VARCHAR(255),
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

3) Load data
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:\\ProgramData\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 8.0\\Uploads\\sales_data.csv'
INTO TABLE your_table_name
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES
(id, date, category, amount);

4) To troubleshoot issue (Optional):

Run the following SQL query to find out the directory that you're allowed to load files from:

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file_priv';

5) Server Side Configuration:

Locate your MySQL server's configuration file, which is typically named my.ini. You can usually find it in the MySQL installation directory or the data directory "C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0".

Open the my.ini file with a text editor running as an administrator.

Look for the [mysqld] section and add the following line if it's not already present:

local_infile=1

6) Restart MySQL

net stop MySQL80
net start MySQL80

7) Before executing command on Command Prompt, make sure "MySQL is added to the PATH Environment Variable".

8) When using the MySQL command-line client (run as administrator), you need to enable local data loading by starting the client with the --local-infile option set to 1. 

mysql -u yourusername -p --local-infile=1
